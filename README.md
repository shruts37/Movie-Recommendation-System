It is a movie recommendation system application based on Content-based filtering. The algorithm used in the project is COSINE SIMILARITY which  measures how similar two items are. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The output value ranges from 0â€“1. 0 means no similarity, where as 1 means that both the items are 100% similar.
